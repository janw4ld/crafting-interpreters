# my journey through "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom

this is my very first time writing java & learning about programming language design, but i'm trying my best to use modern java features and follow sensible practices contrary to the book's commitment to compatibility with Java 7, so my implementation of the `jlox` interpreter is different from the book's exact text.
